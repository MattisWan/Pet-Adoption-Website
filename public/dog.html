            <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                <li><b>Proper Nutrition:</b> Feed your dog a balanced diet appropriate for their age, size, and breed. Choose high-quality dog food and ensure they have access to fresh water at all times. Avoid feeding them harmful foods like chocolate, onions, grapes, and raisins.</li>
                <li><b>Regular Exercise:</b> Dogs need regular exercise to stay healthy and maintain a healthy weight. Take your dog for daily walks, play fetch, or engage in other forms of physical activity to keep them active and mentally stimulated.</li>
                <li><b>Veterinary Care:</b> Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to monitor your dog's health and address any medical concerns. Keep up with vaccinations, flea and tick prevention, and dental care to ensure your dog stays healthy and free from diseases.</li>
                <li><b>Grooming:</b> Regular grooming is essential to keep your dog's coat clean and healthy. Brush your dog's fur regularly to remove dirt, loose hair, and prevent mats. Trim their nails, clean their ears, and brush their teeth regularly to maintain good hygiene.</li>
                <li><b>Love and Attention:</b> Show your dog love and affection through cuddles, playtime, and bonding activities. Spend quality time with your dog and provide plenty of attention to strengthen your bond and build trust.
